TeChN is a small first project to learn the M.E.R.N stack.

It's a project managment WebApp, in which you can create a project, keep up with your tasks, save some documentation and more.

## Instructions

clone this repo & run

I hope that that new devs find this project useful to learn and have an example. Enjoy!
